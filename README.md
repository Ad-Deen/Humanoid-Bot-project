# Humanoid Robot Project

Welcome to the Humanoid Robot Project! This project involves the design, development, and simulation of a humanoid robot. Below, you'll find details on the mechanical design of the leg part and the progress made so far.

## Project Overview

The Humanoid Robot Project aims to create a sophisticated humanoid robot with capabilities ranging from mechanical design to electrical wiring, simulations, and cognitive capabilities. This project is a comprehensive exploration of robotics, covering various engineering disciplines.

## Mechanical Design - Leg Part

In the initial phase of the project, the focus has been on the mechanical design of the leg part. The CAD files for the leg design have been uploaded to the project repository. These files provide detailed insights into the structure and components of the robot's legs.

### CAD Files
