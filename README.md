# Humanoid Robot Project

Welcome to the Humanoid Robot Project! This project involves the design, development, and simulation of a humanoid robot. Below, you'll find details on the mechanical design of the leg part and the progress made so far.

## Project Overview

The Humanoid Robot Project aims to create a sophisticated humanoid robot with capabilities ranging from mechanical design to electrical wiring, simulations, and cognitive capabilities. This project is a comprehensive exploration of robotics, covering various engineering disciplines.

## Mechanical Design - Leg Part

In the initial phase of the project, the focus has been on the mechanical design of the leg part. The CAD files for the leg design have been uploaded to the project repository. These files provide detailed insights into the structure and components of the robot's legs.

### CAD Files

I would really appreciate your Likes, Comment or Share of the model if it's worth your time.

Feel free to explore these CAD files to get a closer look at the mechanical intricacies of the leg design.

## Progress Update

The project is making steady progress, with the completion of the mechanical design phase. The next steps will involve electrical power distribution in actuators, simulations, and the implementation of cognitive capabilities.

## Repository Structure

The project repository is organized to facilitate collaboration and tracking of progress. Here's an overview of the main directories:

- `/mechanical_design`: Contains CAD files and documentation related to the mechanical design phase.
- `/electrical_power_distribution`: Planned directory for electrical wiring schematics and documentation.
- `/simulations`: Future home for simulation models and results.
- `/cognitive_capabilities`: Planned directory for cognitive capabilities development.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the Humanoid Robot Project are welcome! If you're interested in participating, here are some ways to contribute:

1. **Mechanical Design:** Contribute to refining and enhancing the existing mechanical design.
2. **Electrical Wiring:** Contribute expertise in electrical systems and wiring schematics.
3. **Simulations:** Work on simulation models to test and validate the robot's functionalities.
4. **Cognitive Capabilities:** Contribute to the development of cognitive capabilities for the humanoid robot.

Feel free to fork the repository, make your contributions, and submit pull requests.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Simulation Part:

1. Download the CAD file from grabCAD and organize the joints in a parant child relation tree.
2. Keep the base be the waist region.
3. Convert the .f3d to URDF from Fusion 360 using fusion2urdf plugin. You will find further details here.
4. Use the URDF for simulations in Simulating Softwares Like Gazebo 11.

### Power Distribution Part

1. You can Re-edit the model for more practical appearance. I didn't fixed the joint mechanisms in the model.
2. Apply actuators and move the actuators from Electrical power lines with feedback loop of the joint motion.

### Cognitive Capabilities

This part will be worked after we completetly build the mechanical and electrical power distribution all practical actuators in the model.
But you are welcome to do the work on perception stack early on. Let me know your progess and let's collaborate.
